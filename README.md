# There's nothing here
Today (08.12.20) Today I am deleting all codes from the github, since storing them there for free is rather stupid and irrational :/
<br>BUT! 13 sources will be available in python and c ++ (now there are only 10 on github). Compiled formats will also be available (simple .exe)
You can buy them for 0.28 euros, for this you need to contact me in private messages. Then I will send you all of the above and grant you a "gold" privilege on the server.
